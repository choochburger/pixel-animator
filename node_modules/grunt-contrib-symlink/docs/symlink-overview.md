Task targets, files and options may be specified according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide. Pay special attention to the [Building the files object dynamically](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#building-the-files-object-dynamically) section, which explains how to create many src-dest file mappings all at once.

Note that the symlink mode (file, dir) is determined automatically based on the src file type.
